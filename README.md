I'm a game developer of 7 years. Main engine I worked in is Unity, and worked with Unreal engine in free time. Main platforms I worked for was mobile, and of the projects that was most popular was Diableros, reaching 1 million downloads. Gameplay system and mechanics are favourite part of programming, as well as creating AI opponents, with AI opponet I made for Football Clash Arena successfully fooled great percentage of players into thinking they played real people.
